🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. It analyzes key medical parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar to provide an accurate prediction of heart disease risk.

🔍 Features

Data preprocessing and visualization for better understanding

Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, etc.)

Model comparison based on accuracy and performance metrics

User-friendly prediction interface (optional if you built one)

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Objective

To assist healthcare professionals and researchers by providing an early warning system for heart disease risk using data-driven insights.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for web access

Integrate real-time health monitoring data

Improve accuracy with deep learning models.
