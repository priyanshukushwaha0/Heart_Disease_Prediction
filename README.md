🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the probability of a patient suffering from heart disease using different machine learning algorithms. The system will analyze the key medical parameters-age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar level-to give an accurate prediction of heart disease risk.

🔍 Features 

Data preprocessing and visualization for better understanding

Implemented multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM etc.

Model Comparison Based on Accuracy and Performance Metrics

Optional - User-friendly prediction interface if you built one

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊  Objective 

To help clinicians and medical researchers with an early warning system using data-driven insights on heart disease diagnosis.

🚀 Upcoming Improvements

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for web access

Integrate real-time health monitoring data

Improve accuracy with deep learning models.
